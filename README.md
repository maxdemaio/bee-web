## Getting started

- Make sure you have python3 installed
- Use this for creating the venv: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)

Open a terminal in VSCode for this project and then:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Once the installation is complete, run the following command to confirm the installation:

```
python3 -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"
```

## Running the app

- Follow VSCode's guide to debugging/running a Flask app locally: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask#_run-the-app-in-the-debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask#_run-the-app-in-the-debugger)
